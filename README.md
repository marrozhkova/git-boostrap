## 🧑‍🎓 Purpose

This project was created while I was getting acquainted with Bootstrap’s:

- Grid layout system
- Navbar components
- Cards, buttons & responsive utilities
- Typography, spacing, and alignment helpers

It’s not a full-featured app — it’s a **learning sandbox** for building static content quickly with Bootstrap conventions.
